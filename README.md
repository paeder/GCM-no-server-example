GCM-no-server-example
=====================

Allows the sending and receiving of GCM from the device. Only third-party service needed is to store your ids. This project is currently working without any third party server because it only sends messages to itself. You can easily add your perffered storage method for a fully functional example.

For more information on setting up GCM and how this example was created please visit my blog and read:
